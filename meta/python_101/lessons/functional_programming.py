# Functional programing in essence is a programming paradigm that utilizes functions for clean, consistent and maintainable code
# Functional programming:
    # Does not change the data outside the scope of the function.
    # Is easy to maintain and saves a lot of development time.
    # Utilizes reusable functions for clean and elegant code.
